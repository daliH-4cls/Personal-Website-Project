    <h1>Favorite Games:</h1>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Limbus Company</li>
        <p>Limbus Company is genuinely peak. As the younglings say. It's the best written game of all time- beating all triple A games and even other indie games.
            The game's characters are based off of popular books. Some examples being "Moby-Dick," "Don Quixote," "Withering Heights," all of those.
            The way Project Moon develop their characters are fantastic, so many twists and new interpretations of their stories to fit their world and it's amazing.</p>
        <li>99 Nights in the Forest</li>
        <p>Me and my friends play it and it's just really fun, infuriating, and funny.</p>
        <li>Any game with horses</li>
    </ol>
